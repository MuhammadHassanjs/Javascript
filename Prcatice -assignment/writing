Ghostwriting
Hello John,

It was lovely speaking with you today. As discussed, I am attaching the details for your review. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns and I will be able to address them here.

Process:
As soon as the order is placed, A project manager gets in touch with you over the phone. They welcome you onboard and share a couple of questionnaires with you which entail information about the subject of the book and what writing style you prefer.

Once, we have the filled questionnaires, our writing team drafts an outline based on the provided information and shares it with you for your approval. once we have the approval for the outline from you, our writers start writing the first chapter.

The entire book will be done chapter by chapter and you will be called every week to get your feedback. Similarly, the book will be delivered chapter by chapter every week so we can make sure we are moving in the right direction.

Once the book is completed, it is completely formatted as per the international publishing standards and shared with you in Pdf and MS word files.

The calls will be just to receive your feedback. 10-15 minutes at max. If you think calls are going to be tough to schedule, we can do emails as well. And when you think you can make time for calls, we can speak.

This is the package that is offered for the ghostwriting of a book with different quality of writers. 

Writing Package:
